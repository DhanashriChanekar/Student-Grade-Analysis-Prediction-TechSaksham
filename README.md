# Student Final Grade Prediction

## Objective
To predict the final grade (G3) of Portuguese high school students using machine learning models based on demographic, social, and academic features.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of 396 Portuguese students, the goal is to classify whether a student will perform well in the final exam using machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student grades, demographics, social, and school-related attributes collected via reports and questionnaires. It includes data from two subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.

### Key Attributes:
- *Demographics:* Age, sex, address type (urban/rural), family size, parental education & job.
- *Academic Performance:* Grades (G1, G2, G3), past failures, study time, absences.
- *Social Factors:* Extra support, extracurricular activities, family relationship quality, free time, alcohol consumption, and more.

## Methodology
### Importance of Early Grade Prediction:
- Helps identify at-risk students early.
- Assists universities in improving retention and learning support.

### Data Visualization & Analysis:
- KDE, box plots, histograms, count plots.
- Analyzing correlations between student attributes and final grades.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- ElasticNet Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Gradient Boosted Trees

## Experimental Results
### Experimental Results
1. KDE Plot to view all attributes using cufflinks
2. Box Plot to view all attributes using cufflinks
3. Histogram Plot for G3 (Final Grade) using cufflinks
4. Pictorial representation of any null data present in the dataset.
5. Count Plot for Student Sex Attribute
6. Kernel Density Estimation for Age of Students.
7. Count PLot for Male & Female students in different age groups.
8. Count Plot for students from Urban & Rural Region.
9. Does age affect final grade?
10. Do urban students perform better than rural students?
11. Previous Failures vs Final Grade(G3)
12. Family Education vs Final Grade(G3)
13. Higher Education vs Final Grade(G3)
14. Go Out vs Final Grade(G3)
15. Reason vs Students Count
    
### Key Findings:
- Impact of past failures on G3.
- Influence of family education and support.
- Effect of social activities and study habits on final grades.
